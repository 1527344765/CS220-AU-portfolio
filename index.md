## work experience
### A Bilibili uploader and a cyperspace writer
In July 2020, I began to upload my firt video about film on the platform and until now I upload over 187 videos within films, animations games and some vlogs Meanwhile, I tried to seek a part-time job such as a waiter in a restaurant. In addition, I did some online part-time jobs for over a year. In July 2021, I started to upload my own light novels and so far I wrote over two hundred thousand words. Generally, those work experiences help me a lot.

Through imovie on Mac, I have leanrt how to use the imovie to edit the video clips via importing,organizing,packing and soundtracking and finally exporting.Therefore, a new video of opening by my own was produced.

Last two years, I was new to get in touch with video premiere and leanrt to how to use its plenty of functions. And then I used imovie to eidt the best favourite of mine, the Pacific Rim ,I selected some parts of movie clips which I believed were marvellous so that I put them together and edited carefully. Finally, a new video about Pacific Rim was generated by myself.
