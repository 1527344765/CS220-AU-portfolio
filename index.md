### A Bilibili uploader and a cyperspace writer 
In July 2020, I began to upload my firt video about film on the platform and until now I upload over 187 videos within films, animations games and some vlogs Meanwhile, I tried to seek a part-time job such as a waiter in a restaurant. In addition, I did some online part-time jobs for over a year. In July 2021, I started to upload my own light novels and so far I wrote over two hundred thousand words. Generally, those work experiences help me a lot.
