## Main Body

Within the development of website via internet, there is a plenty of people have decided to be  cypercitizens through creating accounts on different social media platforms such as Facebook.As result of it, people get to konw and communicate with different people from different parts of world instead of face-to-face way. Therefore, those people get their own digital identites.As to digital indentity, it is a concept in cyberspace. It refers to the description of a group of individuals or things (sometimes referred to as subject or entity)Data, or all the information about a person available on the Internetsum. It is a type of network used by individuals, organizations or electronic devices.An online identity, or network identity. These individuals, organizations or telecom Sub-devices may have more than one number through different online communities identity. These digital identities are composed of some characteristics or digital attributes.Thus, digital identity provides us with a virtual social circle so that those people can be found by their "footprints".

There are a lot of characteritics about the digital identity.First of all, the digital identity is diverse.In the Internet age, people can build diverse digital identities according to different situations. These digital identities will vary depending on the specific context, purpose of application, and type of service provided. Due to the virtual nature of network communication, people can almost have any identity they want on the network and even have multiple identities at the same time without conflicting with each other.

Secondly, the digital identity is forgeable.The identity attributes provided by individuals can be real,one-sided, historical, anonymous, or tampered or even forged. Therefore, digital identities in cyberspace are natural Falsifiable. Big data technology makes it easy for others to obtain user information, and it can also easily use software to forge other people's identities, resulting in confusion and forgery of digital identities.

Thirdly, the hyperlocality of the digital identity enables people to communicate, learn and trade with each other on the Internet. Therefore, digital identity has obtained the characteristics of transcending regions through the Internet and identity of single individual can be confirmed through digital identities, wherever they are, and digital identities can be used to connect and communicate. 

Finally,digital identity has strong mobility and variability.Network technology makes it difficult to determine online identity of one person, and mobility and variability have become the obvious characteristics of digital identity.

It is undeniable that digital identity owns positive and negative impacts.As for advantages, the most obvious one is users can use personal information flexibly.To be specific, users not only have the right to control access from other people to personal data information, but also can decide when, where and how to publish their own information. In addition, the digitization of personally identifiable information helps users to conduct transactions with the outside world more conveniently.In addition, the ohter benefit is service provider realizes customized service.On the one hand, service providers can customize corresponding products and services according to user attributes and purposes with the help of user identity information recorded in the system. On the other hand, the existence of the digital identity system can effectively replace the previous complicated paper certificates in the process, reduce the cost of repeated communication between service providers and users, and greatly improve work efficiency.

 In terms of the disadvantages of digital identity, lack of authenticity and validity of identity data could be the most difficult trouble. As the result of it,although the network identities of major platforms have basically achieved real-name identification, users have only obtained identity authentication and have not really mastered the control of identity information, which has resulted in many problems. For example, it is impossible to determine whether the user who is using this digital identity is himself, it is difficult to trace the true validity of the digital identity information in the system from the source, and it is even more difficult to correspond the reality with the network identity.Furthermore, the prerequisite for using innternet services is to solve the problem of identity identification and authentication. The use of different services requires multiple different authentications. At present, the identity authentication methods of various departments and platforms are relatively simple and inefficient, and there is a greater risk of personal privacy information leakage, which may lead to the sale of user information, resulting in serious property and damage. Loss of related benefits. In addition, the traditional centralized identity authentication relies on the stability of a single system. Once data leakage occurs in a centralized organization, it will cause serious information security incidents, and the fault tolerance is too low.
 
 Based on those, digital identity not only provides convenient and flexiblity which allows people to get in touch with other people via internet, but also it poses a potential threat to the secruity of privacy of digital citizens.

## My digtial identity on VR map

According to the first VR map, it claimed that the Bilibili, Wechat and personal email were my major activities on resident model.
The visitor model showed that Google browser and YouTube were my more frequent activities on it.
As for the other applications such as Linkedin, I used them much less as most of them are institutional which may have little effect on my cuurent career.
On the other hand, I did not often use Google scholar until there were assignments as it could be a source of citation and references of my essays.

As so far,all of those digital identities showed that personal information, interests and education. Although I spent much more time on wechat as I could communicate with friends conveninently, professional Linkedin account created led a possible way to connect with future.

## Second VR map about my digital identity

After learning more about digital identity, I modify some activities and add something new.At present, I tend to be visitor model on Bilibili and Wechat as the contents including videos and articles recommended could be inducive or deceptive so that I have to distinguish them carefully, while I still spend more time on it in leisure time.Moreover, Alipay and mobile bank, which are most important ways to afford products become the most concerned applications. Witihin secrutiy threat on the internet, I wish to spend much more concentration on them.Otherwise, it can be difficult for me to purchase goods as cash payment becomes less popular.Furthermore, I also hope to explore things that I am interested in or be associated wtih my future possible careers on YouTube via enjoying their videos.Or even, I may get in touch with people who owns the same or similar experiences or interests on Linkedin.

## Conclusion 

Base on above, I considered about my present and digital identity. In most social media platforms, I played roles as vistor or resident model, and own personal accounts. However, As I am a student at present, there is imbalance on time allocations on personal and institutional models, which I perfer personal rather than institutional.Thefore. after acquiring more knowledge about digital identity, I may pay more attention on insitutional models as it may be beneficial for my following digital identities.
